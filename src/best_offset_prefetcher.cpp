/*
* The Best Offset Prefetcher is a prefetching algorithm proposed in the paper 
* Best Offset Hardware Prefetching written by Pierre Michaud. It is a non-PC 
* based prefetching algorithm that propes offsets from an access address
* and selects an offset that generates the most timely prefetches. The prefetcher
* monitors L2 misses and prefetches into the L3 cache.
* 
* A brief API level description: an access comes in (access function), and the amount
* time of until that prefetch is ready is calculated based on the expected time until the access will
* make it to the cache. If the time for the prefetch is greater than the L3 access time
* (signalling that the access is going to DRAM rather than the L3 cache), then one of the 
* offsets within the page (0-63) is tested to see if a prefetch to a previous access + that
* test offset would have generated a timely prefetch. If so, then the "score" associated with 
* that offset is increased. When an offset's "score" approaches the maximum value or 
* all of the offsets have been gone through, the offset with the highest score is used to 
* prefetch from all the accesses that come in. All future accesses are prefetched with that
* offset from that point onwards, hopefully generating timely prefetches, and the next round of 
* learning begins.
* 
* Note that the implemenation of the recent requests table is more complex than that of the 
* algorithm proposed in the paper. The existence of addresses is checked against a hash map
* that tracks a queue of all the most recent requests. When the list gets to capacity,
* the oldest item at the front of the list is removed, and its associated entry in the hash
* map is deleted as well. This leads to a more consistent prefetching offset than the method that 
* the paper proposed, which is to delete all history of the last round by completely clearing 
* the recent request table.
